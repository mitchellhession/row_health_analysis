# **Row Health Analysis**

Row Health is a pioneering healthcare technology company that revolutionizes patient care through personalized and data-driven solutions. In this portfolio project, I analyzed a dataset, composed of real-world data, randomly generated data, and AI generated data, to explore trends in claims, reinbursments, average claim value, product popularity, and marketing campaign performance.  

I used SQL, Dashboards, aggregation functions, and statistical analysis to clean, analyze, and summarize the insights below, to be delivered to the finance and marketing team.
